# Hangman
In this project I need to make a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer.
When I first load the program, I need to implement an option to open one of my saved games.
The program will do display some sort of count so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses they have before the game ends. The program should also display which correct letters have already been chosen (and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which incorrect letters have already been chosen.
Every turn, the program must allow the player to make a guess of a letter. It should be case insensitive. The program must update the display to reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.
